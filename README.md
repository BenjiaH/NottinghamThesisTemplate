# Nottingham Thesis LaTeX Template

This repository includes the LaTeX template and the submission cover for the University of Nottingham thesis/dissertation.

It can be used for:

- AE3IDS Undergraduate final year project (UNNC)
- G53IDS Undergraduate final year project (UNUK)

The template is constructed for the final submission of the thesis based on the [Project handbook](http://workspace.nottingham.ac.uk/pages/viewpage.action!?pageId=130353499) in the university workspace. However it can be adapted for the interim report and hopefully for the thesis in other departments as well.

Please let me know if you find it fits well with any other projects/modules.

Good luck!
