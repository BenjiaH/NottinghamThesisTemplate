# Nottingham Thesis LaTeX Template

This repository includes the LaTeX template and the submission cover for the University of Nottingham thesis/dissertation.

It can be used for:

- AE3IDS Undergraduate final year project (UNNC)
- G53IDS Undergraduate final year project (UNUK)

The template is constructed for the final submission of the thesis based on the [Project handbook](http://workspace.nottingham.ac.uk/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=130353499) in the university workspace (if the link doesn't work, you may search "Final Year (3rd+Year) Project Handbook" in the workspace). 

It can be adapted for the interim report and hopefully for the thesis in other departments as well.

The thesis template includes the sections below:

- Title page
- Abstract page
- Acknowledgement page
- Table of Contents
- Introduction
	- Motivation
	- Aims and Objectives
	- Description of the Work
- Background and Related Work 
- Design
- Implementation
- Evaluation
- Summary and Reflections
	- Project management
	- Contributions and reflections
- Bibliography
- Appendices


Please let me know if you find it fits well with any other projects/modules.

Good luck!
